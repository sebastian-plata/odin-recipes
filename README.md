# odin-recipes
T.O.P's HTML foundations project: "recipes".

Project "recipes" provides an opportunity to test my acquired knowledge of HTML as well as my skills to write said markup language.

The workflow using git for version control goes like:

move files and directories to the stage area:

    git add .
    git add <'fileName'>

commit files from stage area:

    git commit

push files to github:

    git push

To check what's up:

    git status
    git log
