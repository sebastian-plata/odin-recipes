# odin-recipes
T.O.P's HTML foundations project: "recipes".

Project "recipes" provides an opportunity to test my acquired knowledge of HTML as well as my skills to write said markup language.

The workflow using git for version control goes like:

move files and directories to the stage zone:

    git add .
    git add <'fileName'>

git commit

git push

To check what's up:

git status
git log
