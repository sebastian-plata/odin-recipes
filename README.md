# odin-recipes
T.O.P's HTML foundations project: "recipes".

Project "recipes" provides an opportunity to test my acquired knowledge of HTML as well as my skills to write said markup language.

The workflow using git for version control goes like:

move files and directories to the stage area:

    git add .
    git add <'fileName'>

commit files from stage area:

    git commit

push files to github:

    git push
    git push origin main

To check what's up:

    git status
    git log

Usign .webp over .jpg:

WebP images are usually smaller than their counterparts, but with the same quality, thanks to their superior compression. That means using WebP images for your own site will (usually) make it run faster and reduce your data storage at the same time.

According to Google’s own data, WebP lossless compression is 26% smaller than PNGs and its lossy compression is 25-34% smaller than JPEGs.

The other main advantage of WebP is its versatility. It incorporates both transparency and animation.

Pros:

    - Approved by Google
    
    - Faster loading times: every second delay in loading reduces visitor satisfaction by 16% and one in four visitors will abandon you completely if it’s not loaded in 4 seconds.

    - Less media storage: save money on web hosting services.

    - Transparency and animations

Cons: 

    - Not supported by all browsers

    - Quality is still reduced: for visual sites like photography or graphic design portfolios you want your visual quality at maximum.
